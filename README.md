# Audio-Visualizer

What started as a project for IGME 330 (Rich Media Web Application Development 1) has turned into one of my main showcases. The initial project was a collaboration between 
Enan Munzar and myself. We both share an interest in juggling and wanting to utilize that in our project. After hours of designing props in the HTML canavs, and a lot of audio processing, the visualizer was born. With a wide variety of tracks to choose from, you can juggle to the beat of your favorite songs.
